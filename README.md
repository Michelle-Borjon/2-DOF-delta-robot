# 2-DOF-delta-robot
This last semester that I studied, 6th semester, we collaborated as a team to develop a 2 DOF delta robot in which we had to start from the design and its manufacture, up to the programming to detect objects and move them from place to place.

Once again I was part of the design team, I was in charge of designing all the parts of the robot taking into account the calculations made to have a workspace of 45 cm x 20 cm. We had to be very careful in this project because any measurement that wasn't correct wouldn't allow the correct functioning of the robot. Therefore, I also had to be present during the working hours of the manufacturing team to instantly resolve any part or situation that could go wrong.
